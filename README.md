# BIG DATA
## Nouvelle Baguette Magique
Charlie BROSSE, Adrien HUET

You will find in this repository:
- the main notebook _projet_newmagicwand.ipynb_
- the CSV files in _stocks_data_

## 1) Statistics and Analysis
The first part of the notebook contains the data loading part and all the functions from the subject, as well as a main execution cell.
To test each function, you can comment/uncomment lines from this cell to run our functions on the datasets

## 2) Preprocessing and Machine Learning Model
This second part regroups all the functions necessary to run our model and the preprocessing of the dataset. You will find again a main execution cell.
